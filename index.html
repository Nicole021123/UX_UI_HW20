      <h3 class="my-6">UX Research, UI Design</h3>
      <p>As a result of collective deliberation, ProjectStay emerged as the unanimous choice for a group project. We arrived at this decision based on the non-profit organization's lack of responsive web design for mobile devices. Furthermore, the current website suffered from a user-unfriendly and unreliable content layout, posing challenges for visitors in comprehending the services provided by ProjectStay.</p>

        <p>Project Stay was designed to assist individuals with securing a post secondary education. We have observed the website has misleading information and lacks clear navigation which is causing individuals to not utilize the Project Stay resources. How might we improve the design navigation and content layout so that users can easily determine the onboarding process and follow through with services.</p>

      <p>I created a fully-functional, high-fidelity prototype of the new flows using Figma. At the same time, we started recruiting subjects for the test who fit our criteria. We did 2 usability tests in the first round and 2 after iterating on the issues that weâ€™ve identified:</p>
      <h3>Issue 01</h3>

      <h4>Content</h4>

      <p>Initial usability testing we were able to quantify the pain points we found through our Heuristic Evaluation. We followed our analysis with a redline and annotation of the site to ensure we outlined the correct information architecture needed for transparency.</p>

      <h3>Solution 01</h3>

      <h4>Restructure of Navigation</h4>

      <p>Based on our research conducted we identified three pain points a user had and determined the biggest impact would be to restructure the content layout.</p>
  <ol id="list-unstyled">
    <ol>
      <li>Make information clearer so it requires less clicks to find it.</li>
      <li>Allow for the site to guide the user and not make them find information on their own.</li>
      <li>Add hours of operation.</li>

      <h1>UI Design</h1>
        <p>Challenges encountered during the website redesign process included the absence of specific content for each service offered, which made it difficult to determine the target audience, potential pain points, and the overall process.</p>

        <p>In the initial iteration, it became evident that the chosen color palette was too harsh and had a negative impact on the overall design.</p>
        
        <p>During testing, a user expressed difficulty with the Financial Aid tab and recommended either changing it or adding a hover status to the navigation bar.</p>
        
        <p>We conducted desktop prototype testing with four users in two rounds. All four users were current students who fit our proto-persona. To validate our original hypothesis, we employed a storyboard scenario to guide users through usability and satisfaction testing surveys. The testing process confirmed the effectiveness of our redesigned content layout and provided a clear understanding of how ProjectStay contributes to the academic goals of its users.</p>

    <h1>Next Steps</h1>
      <p>We conducted 1 usability testing for the mobile prototype (proto-persona user) Due to time management, there was a lack of testing to validate our hypothesis around a content restructure.</p>
      <p>For future iterations, I would like to update the mobile prototype to ensure it is meeting the Responsive Web Design layout requirements and UI Design Principles. In addition, update the desktop header and footer to ensure it meets accessibility requirements and UI Design Principles.</p>
      <p>Based on the findings from UX research we were able to identify future iterations for an increase in user impact. Many of the iterations were around the design rather than the content layout, which allowed for us to validate our original hypothesis for transparency.</p>
      <p>With each design decision and iteration, we noticed a change in culture which directly related back to our Brand Voice Identity goals. Inviting, trustworthy, clear and helpful were all things we seeked for our overall accomplishments.</p>
      <p>In the end we expect for ProjectStay to increase their average page views per visit.</p>

    <h1>Learnings</h1>
      <p>As I engage in ongoing collaborations with various peers, I have gained valuable insights into diverse approaches for generating ideas and ensuring active participation from everyone involved. Through consistent practice, I have developed effective communication strategies that encourage each team member to engage in self-discovery throughout the entire design process.</p>
      <p>As a designer, my continuous practice with Figma has significantly accelerated my ability to create mid to high fidelity designs efficiently. Additionally, I recently utilized Figma for the first time to align with my peer's preference for a mobile kit, allowing me to craft a design that harmonized seamlessly with their chosen framework.</p>
